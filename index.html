                           <p>Jessica Mack accepted the role and responsibility as the co-editor for The Blazer, the Joliet
                                Junior College student newspaper, in the fall of 2018 despite having only one short semester of
                                experience with the publication. She did not disappoint.</p>
                            <p>Despite her limited previous experience, she took on that responsibility without hesitation when I
                                asked her to serve. We needed someone, and she stepped up to the challenge. She dived into the
                                work in the summer of 2018, spending a great deal of time preparing the newspaper for the
                                beginning of the fall session.</p>
                            <p>As co-editor in the fall of 2018, she led the newspaper to its second straight Best of Show award
                                in the Illinois Community College Journalism Association (ICCJA) contest sponsored by Eastern
                                Illinois University. In the spring of 2019, she personally took home several individual awards as
                                the newspaper gathered in about a dozen individual and staff awards in the annual ICCJA spring
                                contest.</p>
                            <p>Although she had some help during the summer of 2018 prepping the newspaper and putting
                                together a staff, she quickly became the true editor of the newspaper as her co-editor was forced
                                to take on other responsibilities outside the publication. As the leader of the newspaper, she was
                                also forced to take on the role of ad director when the ad director quit suddenly at mid-year.
                                During all of this time, she also served as the lead writer for the award-winning publication and
                                led a novice group to one of the newspaper’s best years in the 22 that I have advised it.
                                Jessica is mature, smart, and serious about her work and her future. I have had the pleasure and
                                privilege to work with many great student editors during my career at JJC and in my previous
                                position as adjunct professor and newspaper adviser at Point Park University in Pittsburgh, and
                                Jessica stands among the best of them.</p>
                            <p>I look forward to following her career in the coming years because I know she will be successful
                                in whatever path she takes. As her former adviser and instructor, I will take great pleasure in
                                watching her succeed.</p>

                           <p>I first encountered Jessica Mack in October 2019. My first editor had done a decent job editing my automotive industry expose’ but it still wasn’t where I wanted it. Problem: I was out of money. 
                              I spotted Jessica‘s ad on FB saying she was willing to edit 1 or 2 books free of charge to get her name out there. </p>
                           <p>I messaged her with a challenge: I’m not a writer by trade and my 191,00 word 'expose needs to be scrubbed and polished. After three months, 
                              Jessica had taken the somewhat crude writings of this auto mechanic and made it into an enjoyable read.</p>
                           <p>However, there was another problem: at 191,000 we both agreed it was way too long for the average reader. She suggested it be compressed. I couldn’t see doing that because I had A LOT to say. 
                              We both agreed to make my book into a series, and with skill far beyond her years carved my 191,000 words into 4 books. </p>

              <h4 style="font-size: 16px">Bringing text to life is my passion</h4>
              <p>Ever since I could remember, I have constantly had my nose in a book. I knew that being in the writing and editing industry was what my true passion was all along, so I strive to bring my own passion to the table.</p>
              <br>
              <h4 style="font-size: 16px">My hope is to bring your passion to life as well</h4>
              <p>There is nothing better than having someone else there to help you, step-by-step along the way. My goal is to completely transform your writing into a full-fledged transformational revision. My dedication to perfection can guarantee that I'll put my heart and soul into your project.</p>
              <br>
              <h4 style="font-size: 16px">Short or long, I'll help you through it</h4>
              <p>While I mostly work with fiction, whether it's a resume and cover letter you're looking to have fixed, article writing or a complete book manuscript, I've got you covered.</p>
