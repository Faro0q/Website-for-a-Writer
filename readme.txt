Hi,

Site created using Bootstrapious template.

CSS
----------

The theme stylesheet is css/style.default.css. If you want to make any changes, 
you can do it here or better to override it in custom.css so you can update the original theme stylesheet if an updated is released. 

JavaScript
----------

Apart from the Bootstrap JS components, the majority of JS is located in /js/front.js. 


Contact Form
----------

To make the Contact form work on your site, you have to provide a back-end solution in a language of your choice. For a PHP solution, check out  my tutorial at https://bootstrapious.com/p/how-to-build-a-working-bootstrap-contact-form.
